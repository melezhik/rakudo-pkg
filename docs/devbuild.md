# Using rakudo-pkg for testing upstream Rakudo

This repo can be used to test the upstream MoarVM/NQP/Rakudo and zef releases.
In order to do this fork this repo, go to Actions and enable the `devbuild`
action.

![Enabled action](actions.png?raw=true "Actions")

You can run the `devbuild action` by clicking on `Run workflow` where you can
customise the build and give a version for MoarVM, NQP, Rakudo and zef (HEAD,
a tag or a commit) and the configure command for MOARVM, NQP and Rakudo. You
can also supply a command to e.g. make changes to the source files and add
environment variables to the build system. You can also change the branch if
needed (e.g. a work-in-progress test setup).

![devbuild workflow](devbuild.png?raw=true "devbuild workflow")

Tests are run in verbose mode. If the build process produces corefiles, 
you'll find them as a zipped artifact below the run workflow.

Don't forget to update your fork regularly, so new OS releases are added to the
actions and/or functionality added to the flow:

```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/nxadm/rakudo-pkg.git
git pull upstream master
```
